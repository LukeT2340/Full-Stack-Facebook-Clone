# MERN Facebook Clone

A full-stack Facebook clone built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. This project aims to replicate the core features of Facebook, including user authentication, profile management, status updates, and real-time messaging (not finished yet).
This project is not yet complete. You can check out my progress here:

I know that building Facebook and Twitter clones is something a lot of CS students do and there are a million tutorials on Youtube of how to do it. You can be rest assured I did not follow any tutorial for this project. I designed it completely myself :). If I didn't know how to do something I'd google it or use ChatGPT. Thanks for your time!
